# Jarvis-CD
Jarvis-CD is a unified platform for deploying various applications, including
storage systems and benchmarks. Many applications have complex configuration
spaces and are difficult to deploy across different machines.

We provide a builtin repo which contains various applications to deploy.
We refer to applications as "jarivs pkgs" which can be connected to form
"deployment pipelines".

Our full guide for installing and bootstrapping is located [here](https://grc.iit.edu/docs/jarvis/jarvis-cd/index).
